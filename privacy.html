  <h1>Privacy Policy – Scholix</h1>

  <p>Scholix respects the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle personal information collected through the mobile application, which is independently developed and allows users to access academic information retrieved from third-party systems such as Webtop and Michlol4 ("external systems"). We are not affiliated with or endorsed by these external systems.</p>

  <p>This policy does not apply to the processing of information by those external systems themselves, but only to information handled by the App. This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of the App’s terms of use.</p>

  <strong>Use of External Login Information</strong>
  <p>In order to use the App, users are required to enter their login credentials (e.g., username and password) from the relevant educational system. These details are entered by the user directly and are not transmitted to our servers. Instead, they are stored securely on the user’s device to enable data access from the external system.</p>

  <p>No additional personal information is required to use the App, and users are not required to create any accounts within the App. Optionally, users may enter a nickname or customize local preferences, which are also stored locally and not transmitted externally.</p>

  <strong>Information Collected During App Usage</strong>
  <p>The App does not collect or transmit personal data to any server. All interactions are limited to user-initiated access to the external systems (Webtop, Michlol4), using the provided credentials. No personal or behavioral analytics, tracking cookies, advertising identifiers, or similar technologies are used.</p>

  <p>The App may request internet access to perform its core functions — retrieving and displaying school-related data. This communication occurs only between the App and the external systems the user has authenticated with.</p>

  <strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>
  <p>This App is intended for use by students, including children under the age of 13. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The App does not request or collect any personal information from children. No accounts are created, no personal information is transmitted, and no in-app tracking or advertising is performed.</p>

  <p>Parents can manage access by deleting the app or clearing data on the device. No information is accessible to us or stored externally.</p>

  <strong>Information Security</strong>
  <p>We implement security measures to protect data stored locally within the app on the user’s device. However, we do not control the security measures used by the external systems the App connects to. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials.</p>

  <strong>No Affiliation Disclaimer</strong>
  <p>This App is independently developed and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Webtop, Michlol4, or any educational institution. Use of the App is at the discretion of the user, and access to external systems is governed by those systems' terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <strong>Changes to This Policy</strong>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the App or made available on a public URL. Continued use of the App after such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
