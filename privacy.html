  <p>This app is designed to help students access academic information by connecting to external platforms such as Webtop and Michlol4. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by these services. This application is independently developed and uses only public or user-supplied access credentials to retrieve information directly from those platforms.</p>

  <p>The app requires internet access to fetch data directly from the services mentioned above. This communication happens between the app and those external systems only. We do not see, intercept, or store this data.</p>

  <p>The app is suitable for children under the age of 13 and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). It does not use advertising, analytics, or any tracking tools. No account creation is required. All information stays within the app and on the user’s device.</p>

  <p>If you wish to delete stored data, you may do so through the app’s settings or by uninstalling the app.</p>
